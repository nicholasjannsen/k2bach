## Title and Abstract

K2: A Search for Exoplanets and Variable Stars

"The space telescope Kepler has with its extremely high photometric precision revolutionized the studies of exoplanets. With the initiation in 2014 of the new mode of observation called the K2 mission, the photometric quality did however decrease due to the spacecraft's inability to point precisely. However, the K2 mission provides an opportunity to continue Kepler's groundbreaking discoveries in the field of planetary science. Furthermore, it became the foundation for many new and exiting astrophysical studies. 

In this project, I have explored the astrophysical diversity in data from the K2 mission. I have developed a program that effectively extracts photometric light curves for the targets of interest. For a further photometric improvement, a filter designed for the Kepler missions was added. The functionality of the combined routine was evident from our independent discovery of an exoplanet candidate as well as several variable stars. A detailed analysis of the planet candidate suggests a hot Jupiter-sized planet due to its radius and semimajor axis of $R_p=1.08 \jup{R}$ and $a=0.04 \si{AU}$, respectively. However, future studies are needed in order to confirm the planet interpretation."
